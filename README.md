# js-algorithms-and-data-structure

## Why this?
I have not practiced algorithms & data structures for a while, so I have already forgotten a lot of things. 
So, I create this repo for practicing. 

## Why JS?
As you know, we have learnt algorithms & data structure when we was a student on university. The implementation was ussually on C++ or Java.
This time, I want to re-implementate it by a most trending language, JS.

## Contribution
1. If you would like to ask me to implement a specific algorithm or data structure, just raise an issue.
2. If you would like to join with me, please pull a new request.

Thank you
